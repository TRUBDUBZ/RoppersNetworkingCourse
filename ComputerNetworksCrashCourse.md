# Computer Networks Crash Course

- Networks are all about **communications**

- the first computers were used in 1950s and 1960s within organizations to help with communications

- punch cards or reels of tape came before computer networks

- Local Area Networks anywhere from 2 - 2000 computers connected to a single common ethernet cord

- in a LAN the ethernet cord is shared amongst all other computers and used to send receive / read and write data.

- when a computer wants to transmit data, it writes it into the ethernet cord. to organize the data each computer has a 'Media Access Control' aka the MAC Address

  - this is called 'Carrier Sense Multiple Access', or CSMA for short. The 'Carrier', in this case is any shared transmission medium that carries data - copper wire in the case of ethernet and the air carrying the radio waves with wi-fi

  - many computers can sense the carrier. the rate at with the carrier can send the data is called its **Bandwidth**

  - using a shared carrier has a big drawback. as network traffic increases so does the risk of a collision / data lost due to collision

  - exponential backoff is whats used to stop network congestion

  - circuit switching - switching two whole circuits 

  - the us military still uses circuit switching to communiate between bases
  
  - hop count - shows the locations used while hopping to end location - can help find and fix routing errors

  - packets - slicing up data into smaller formats to help with network traffic

    - TCP/IP
    - UDP

  - packet switching - is so efficient its stil what keeps the internet running today. 

  - ARPANET - the original design of the world wide web

  - estimated 10 billion devices connected to the internet today
