# Why Networking?

- Networking is hands down the most important thing to understand in security, and still, people just kind of fumble through it. One of the reasons this stuff is so hard is because most people just don't spend enough time with it to get an innate knowledge of what is going on, which makes things hard to conceptualize. 

- The other reason, and I think the main reason, is because all the courses about networking focus on memorizing random things and doing calculations, but don't spend any time looking at packets. It's like if you were trying to learn how to be a carpenter by looking at furniture. Stupid.

- People waste too much time "learning networking". This course is here to fix that. Build your mental models now, learn what is actually happening, then save the memorization for later. Everything is easier when you understand the context.

## Memorization and the lack thereof

Downsides to memorizing everything: 
    
    1. It is worse to be wrong and fast than right and slow. In computing, knowledge is literally always at your fingertips.
    2. Having the wrong things "memorized" can cause serious problems if you do something that breaks a network(especially if you are remote and not standing in the same room as the computer you are "fixing".) Using **cheatsheets** completely avoids this problems
    3. If youre implementing something you use the specification. Full stop. No negotiating. Why memorize a spec if you can look it up and know what it needs to be
    4. The time required to memorize these things is more than the time it takes to be good at things. Don't memorize, take notes, make cheat sheets, and always be willign to get your hands dirty.
    5. There's no shame in google, but there is shame in being bad at networking.

  - so don't be like everyone who has "taken a networking class in college" and couldn't route their way out of a paper bag, but for a 4 month period could tell you all the common port numbers. Learn how to bend packets and make them dance, and look up the music as you go along.
